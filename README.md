# projectiles_learning
This is a small piece of machine learning algorithm written in python that predicts the trajectories of a projectile

# How to run
The python script need python3 and numpy (a module in python) to run
How to install numpy can be found here -> https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html

Use python3 to run the program as follows:
```
python3 analysis.py
```
After running the script, the final trajectories points of the projectile can be found in result.txt, as well as full matrix in console.

# Predict projectiles launched at arbitrary angles and velocities
change vx and vy at line 72, 73 to be the first point in the trajectory. (The position at 10ms)
